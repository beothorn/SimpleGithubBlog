    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake</a> is a fractal curve that arises from recursively dividing a line 
    segment in three sections and replacing the middle section with two line segments that forms a triangle.
It`s a really famous fractal and one that`s really easy to draw.
</p>
<p>
    One cool property of this fractal is that if you switch randomly the direction of the top of the middle section triangle you get a 
    line that resembles a coast.

<p>
    I`ve written an interactive version of the koch snowflake, 
    including the option to randomly change the triangle direction and a slider to increase/decrease the middle section size.

    Have fun playing with it :)
